    - the contract is always paused

    During that transition, the owner is set to the zero address.

    In the WORKING phase:
    - siphons cannot be changed
    - ERC20 operations happen as usual
    - the pauser can pause and unpause the contract

    Once in WORKING, the contract cannot move back to SETUP.

    are immutable as well.

    false (immutable). After OldRSR is paused, the entries in those maps can change to true.
    Once the entry value is true, it remains immutable.
