# Mainnet RSR
This repo contains the code for a mainnet Reserve Rights token (RSR) that upgrades from a previously deployed version of RSR, found [here](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr).

## Naming

The previously deployed version of RSR is referred to in this repo as `OldRSR`. The intended target of this name is the 2019-deployed RSR found at address `0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8` on Ethereum mainnet. This enables all `RSR` references to be to the newly upgraded 2022 RSR. 

Relatively incomplete instructions for developers to setup, configuration, and use the tools in this repository.
