# Mainnet RSR
[![Tests](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr-mainnet/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr-mainnet/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This repo contains the code for a mainnet Reserve Rights token (RSR) that upgrades from a previously deployed version of RSR, found [here](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr) and at `0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8` on Ethereum mainnet.

## Context

We need to upgrade our old RSR contract, mostly to unlock tokens on the old RSR contract that were "locked forever" -- with the intent of staying locked until our mainnet protocol launch. Now that our mainnet protocol is on its way, we need to deploy an upgraded RSR so that it can be in use in advance of that protocol's launch.

The transfer of tokens from the old RSR contract to the new one is intended to be entirely automatic. The new RSR contract is aware of the old RSR contract, and it will simply use the old RSRâ€™s balances as the starting balances of new RSR accounts. We do this, here, by overriding the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `balanceOf` functions in order to implement the [copy-on-write pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write). (Alternately, think of this as a lazy copy of all balances.)


## Weights and Balance Crossings

But this implementation is definitely not as simple as a lazy copy; for a handful of addresses, we also need to change the owning address, and we sometimes need to divvy the balance at an old address among several new addresses.  To accommodate this, we set up a matrix of weights to be consulted during the "copy" step of that copy-on-write, which we configure after we deploy this RSR contract and before we pause-and-transition balances from the old RSR contract.

Instead, imagine for a moment that we have a matrix totalWeights, of type mapping(address => mapping(address => uint16)). By default, we start with

    totalWeights[old][new] == (old == new) ? WEIGHT_ONE : 0

Before transitions, every time the admin calls siphon(old, prev, to, weight), we do

    totalWeights[old][prev] -= weight;
    totalWeights[old][to]   += weight;

When we read new balances, then, for any address A, the inherited balanceOf(A) is:

    sum_{all addresses B} ( totalWeights[B][A] * oldRSR.balanceOf(B) / WEIGHT_ONE; )

----

But it's not quite that simple, either. Because gas, we don't want to initialize a matrix with at least one nonzero values for each address that holds some RSR, so we don't directly represent totalWeights. Instead, we actually store `weights` and `hasWeights`. The effective `totalWeights` value can be computed as follows:

   totalWeights(A,B) == (hasWeights[A] ? weights[A][B] : ( (A == B) ? WEIGHT_ONE : 0 )

----

Allowance crossings don't need weighted many-to-many distributions, and are thus much simpler.

## Roles

There are 3 roles in the new RSR:
- Pauser: Can pause and unpause the ERC20 + ERC2612 functions. Intended to eventually be set to the zero address but kept longer than `owner`
- Mage: Intra-tx role assigned temporarily in order to cast one-use spells. Never the sender of a tx and always the zero address at rest
- Owner: Greatest access role. Held between deployment and forktime, during which it is set to the zero address.

## Spells

A spell is a contract that implements a one-time series of commands atomically on another contract. Only the owner of RSR can cast spells. 

We have two spells, currently:
- SiphonSpell: For performing a series of RSR siphons in a single tx in order to prepare weights
- ForkSpell: For completing the fork to RSR

## Lifecycle

RSR is deployed paused, in a Setup state. During this time, instances of the `SiphonSpell` can be cast as the old RSR continues to function. ERC20 + ERC2612 functions revert, and `balanceOf` reads a balance from old RSR. Once the crossing weights of RSR have been prepared sufficiently, the fork can be (nearly) completed by executing `ForkSpell`, pausing old RSR and unpausing the upgraded RSR, as well as setting the owner to zero. At some time after the fork and confirmed proper functioning of the new RSR, the pauser role should also be set to the zero address. 

## ERC20 caveat: Total Supply

The total supply of new RSR is fixed at 100 billion. However, due to rounding during crossings, it is possible for the sum of all balances on new RSR to be less than this amount. The delta is on the order of a handful of quanta of RSR, and may even be 0 if there are no complicated siphons that introduce rounding. 

## Security

An independent review and audit was performed by [Solidified](https://solidified.io/). The final report is located in the `audits` directory.

All core smart contracts are immutable, and cannot be upgraded.
